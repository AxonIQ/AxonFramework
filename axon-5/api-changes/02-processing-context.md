# Axon Framework 5 — API Changes: ProcessingContext and Unit of Work

> Part of the Axon Framework 4→5 migration guide.
> Covers: complete rewrite of `UnitOfWork` into `ProcessingLifecycle` / `ProcessingContext`, removal of `ThreadLocal`,
> new lifecycle phases, and how legacy components (Sagas) interact with the new context.

## Unit of Work

The `UnitOfWork` interface has been rewritten with roughly three goals in mind:

1. Ensure the API of the `UnitOfWork` easily supports imperative and reactive programming styles.
2. Remove the use of the `ThreadLocal` entirely. This change is paramount for a reactive programming style.
3. Guard users from operations they shouldn't touch. The biggest example of this, was the previous `UnitOfWork#commit`
   operation that **was not** intended to be used by users.

To that end, we broke down the `UnitOfWork` interface into two interfaces and a concrete implementation, being:

1. The `ProcessingLifecycle`, describing methods to register actions into distinct `ProcessingLifeCycle.Phases`, thus
   managing the "lifecycle of a process."
2. The `ProcessingContext`, an implementation of the `ProcessingLifecycle` adding resource management.
3. The `UnitOfWork`, an implementation of the `ProcessingContext` and thus `ProcessingLifecycle`.

The user is intended to interface with the `ProcessingLifecycle` when they need to add actions before/after/during
pre-defined `ProcessingLifecycle.DefaultPhases`.
This will allow us, and them, to customize processes like message handling.
Furthermore, the `ProcessingLifecycle` works with a `CompletableFuture` throughout.

The `ProcessingContext` will in turn provide the space to register resources to be used throughout the
`ProcessingLifecycle`.
Although roughly similar to the previous resource management of the old `UnitOfWork`, we intend this format to replace
the use of the `ThreadLocal`. As such, you will notice that the `ProcessingContext` will become a parameter throughout
virtually **all** infrastructure interfaces Axon Framework provides. This will become most apparent on all message
handlers.

It is the replacement of the interfaces with the old `UnitOfWork`, and the spreading of the `ProcessingContext`
instead of the `UnitOfWork` directly, will ensure that operation that are not intended for the end user cannot be
accessed easily anymore.

To conclude, here is a list of changes to take into account concerning the `UnitOfWork`:

1. Operations like `start()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` are no longer available for the user directly.
2. The nesting functionality of the old `UnitOfWork` through operations like `parent()` and `root()` are completely
   removed.
3. The `UnitOfWork` used to revolve around a `Message`, which is no longer the case for the `ProcessingContext`/
   `ProcessingLifeycle`. Instead, the new approach revolves around a generic action, that may or may not return a
   result.
4. You are no longer tied to the predefined not-started, started, prepare-commit, commit, after-commit, rollback,
   clean-up, and closed phases. Instead, the default phases now are pre-invocation, invocation, post-invocation,
   prepare-commit, commit, and after-commit.
5. The default phases are ordered through the use of an `int`, with space between them to add action before, after, or
   during any phase.
6. The `rollback` logic has been replaced by an on-error, on-complete, and on-finally flow.
   `ProcessingLifecycle#onError` registers an action to be taken on error, while `whenComplete` registers an action to
   performed when after worked as intended. `ProcessingLifecycle#doFinally` registers an operation that is performed on
   success **and** failure of the `ProcessingLifecycle`.
7. Correlation data management, and thus construction of the initial `Metadata` of any `Message`, is removed entirely.
   This is inline with the `UnitOfWork` no longer revolving around a `Message`.
8. The "current" `UnitOfWork` (including the `CurrentUnitOfWork`) is no longer a concept. Instead, all infrastructure
   components will pass along the current context by containing the `ProcessingContext` as a parameter throughout.

Note that the rewrite of the `UnitOfWork` has caused _a lot_ of API changes and numerous removals. For an exhaustive
list of the latter, please check [here](11-class-reference.md#removed-classes).

## Legacy components

During the development of Axon Framework 5, we have decided that some features move to the legacy package, such as
Sagas. These are features that we think should be either removed, or that deserve a big overhaul in a future version.
Meanwhile, users can thus use the legacy package to continue using these features, while we can focus on the new
features and improvements in Axon Framework 5.

However, even these legacy components have seen some changes. The most notable one is that most of these components
require a `ProcessingContext` to be passed in. This is to ensure good cooperation between old and new parts of the
framework. This means that some changes might be necessary in your code, such as passing in the
`ProcessingContext` to the `InterceptorChain`:

```java
public class MyInterceptingEventHandler {

    @MessageHandlerInterceptor
    public void handle(MyEvent event, InterceptorChain chain, ProcessingContext context) {
        chain.proceedSync(context);
    }
}
```

You are able inject the `ProcessingContext` in any message-handling method, so this is always available. Any code that
uses the old `UnitOfWork` should be rewritten to put resources in this context.

We will provide a migration guide, as well as OpenWrite recipes for these scenarios.
